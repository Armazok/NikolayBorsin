Front-end developer
-------------------

My journey in IT started in 2020, at that time I started to get interested in this field and decided to start learning on my own. The first step was Dmitry Valak's BrainsCloud course, which gave me a good start, I also completed several courses on the Udemy platform to consolidate fundamental knowledge and get the necessary skills for further development in this field. Since 2022, I seriously decided to get into development and enrolled in an IT incubator. To this day, I am actively developing my skills and delving into learning new technologies to become more competent.
