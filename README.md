Front-end developer
-------------------

In 2020, I first delved into the world of information technology. My interest in this field motivated me to embark on self-learning. The first step on this journey was Dmitry Valak's course titled 'BrainsCloud,' which significantly prepared me for further immersion. In addition to this, I completed several educational programs on the Udemy platform. This allowed me to solidify fundamental knowledge and gain the necessary skills required for my development in this field.

With the arrival of 2021, I made the decision to delve deeper into development and joined IT Incubator. From that point onward, I have been actively engaged in project activities, applying the accumulated knowledge in practice. My efforts are focused on expanding my technical arsenal and mastering cutting-edge technological solutions to enhance my competence in this field. My journey continues, and I am committed to continuous improvement in order to achieve new heights in the world of information technology.
